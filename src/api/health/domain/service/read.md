In the case of an in-memory repository, the service interacts directly with the in-memory repository to perform operations on the data.

Here's an example of how the service and the in-memory repository are connected:

The HealthService depends on the HealthRepository interface. This dependency is typically injected into the service's constructor.

In the HealthService methods, you can use the methods defined in the HealthRepository interface to perform operations on the health data.

When you call a method in the HealthService, such as checkHealth(), the service can use the injected HealthRepository instance to retrieve or update the health status data.

In the case of an in-memory repository, the repository implementation, such as InMemoryHealthRepository, holds the actual data in memory and provides the necessary methods to interact with that data.
